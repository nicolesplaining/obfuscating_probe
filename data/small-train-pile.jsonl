Activity streams are becoming a more common mechanism in software services, particularly social systems (e.g., Facebook® (FACEBOOK is a registered trademark of Facebook, Inc.), IBM Smart Cloud for Social Business, etc.). Current mechanisms require direct interaction between the event source and the event feed, where either the event source pushes events to the activity stream via defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or the activity stream pulls events from the source via a feed-like method. There are a set of scenarios, though, where these methods are lacking, for example, when the source is unable to reach the stream through normal access such as may be the case when behind a firewall or otherwise unavailable for web-based access, when the stream does not have open or standard interfaces, when synchronous interaction is not possible, and when the source is older and potentially unmodifiable code.

Then we examine the effect of droplet partial solidification on recoil and simulate more challenging icing conditions by impacting supercooled water droplets (down to -15 °C) onto flexible and rigid surfaces containing ice nucleation promoters (AgI). We demonstrate a passive mechanism for shedding partially solidified (recalescent) droplets-under conditions where partial solidification occurs much faster than the natural droplet oscillation-which does not rely on converting droplet surface energy into kinetic energy (classic recoil mechanism).
