Activity streams are becoming a more common mechanism in software services, particularly social systems (e.g., Facebook® (FACEBOOK is a registered trademark of Facebook, Inc.), IBM Smart Cloud for Social Business, etc.). Current mechanisms require direct interaction between the event source and the event feed, where either the event source pushes events to the activity stream via defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or the activity stream pulls events from the source via a feed-like method. There are a set of scenarios, though, where these methods are lacking, for example, when the source is unable to reach the stream through normal access such as may be the case when behind a firewall or otherwise unavailable for web-based access, when the stream does not have open or standard interfaces, when synchronous interaction is not possible, and when the source is older and potentially unmodifiable code.

Then we examine the effect of droplet partial solidification on recoil and simulate more challenging icing conditions by impacting supercooled water droplets (down to -15 °C) onto flexible and rigid surfaces containing ice nucleation promoters (AgI). We demonstrate a passive mechanism for shedding partially solidified (recalescent) droplets-under conditions where partial solidification occurs much faster than the natural droplet oscillation-which does not rely on converting droplet surface energy into kinetic energy (classic recoil mechanism).

{"text": ". For example, in the hippocampus there is abundant cellular and molecular information about long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD), the cellular manifestation of long lasting synaptic plasticity. LTP and LTD can be induced by different induction paradigms that depend on presynaptic rate, on pairing presynaptic spikes with postsynaptic depolarization, and on the precise time difference between pre and postsynaptic spikes. We have recently hypothesized that a single model, which depends on calcium influx through NMDA receptors can account for these different induction paradigms. Here we propose a more detailed study of the molecular dynamics, including improved but simple models of CaMKII and Calcinurin that underlie synaptic plasticity. Based on this detailed study as well as new experimental results and measured parameters, we will develop an updated version of the unified plasticity model (UPM) that can be quantitatively tested. We hypothesize that fluctuations in molecular dynamics can play a significant role in the resulting synaptic plasticity. We propose to analyze these fluctuations and calculate their effect on"}

In the present study we investigated cell population kinetics using rat chloroleukaemia cells propagated in suspension culture in vitro. The parameters were measured: doubling time of the population, fraction of labelled mitoses, changes in labelling index with time after pulse labelling, continuous labelling and stathmokinetic index. Analysis of the results was based on a computer program CECAM, which is a stochastic model capable of simulating essentially all types of kinetic experiments based on presently known assay techniques. The results showed that precise and reliable information on cell population kinetics could not be obtained from the analysis of any single type of experimental data. In particular, the technique of labelled mitoses underestimated the duration of the G1 phase, owing to subtle label-induced changes in population behaviour. These changes could not have been detected with any certainty without rigorous quantitative comparisons with other types of experimental data. As a whole, however, results obtained by the different techniques were in agreement and the kinetic behaviour of chloroleukaemia cells"}

{"text": " the major advantage of binocular vision is acute depth perception. I present an alternative, an 'eye-forelimb' (EF) hypothesis, suggesting that alterations in the OC influence the length of neural pathways that transmit visual information to motor nuclei and somatosensory areas involved in forelimb coordination. Evolutionary processes resulting in increased ipsilateral retinal projections (IRP) are of adaptive value in animals that regularly use the forelimbs in a frontal position, while evolutionary change towards reduced IRP is of value for animals that mainly use the forelimbs in lateral positions. Primates and cats, to a large extent, use visually guided forelimb maneuvers, and both groups have high proportions of IRP. The fact that vertebrates' IRP arise exclusively from the temporal retina supports the hypothesis, since IRP from the nasal retina would increase the length of neural pathways involved in forelimb coordination.

They found that polymorphisms in DC-SIGN gene promoter were associated with increased risk in CRC patients, while a SNP in REG4 might be a useful marker for CRC progression. The association of polymorphisms of genes encoding DC-SIGN with nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk has also been investigated.

The development of a microarray resource, covering a wide range of brain and non-brain tissues, at several points of development will enable investigations of gene expression in the vervet. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies will provide anatomic guidance for dissection of brain tissues for microarrays. The tools generated from this project will facilitate investigation of a wide range of human diseases and traits, including complex behaviors and infectious diseases. The utility of such studies derives from the fact that humans are much more similar to other primates than they are to other model organisms such as the mouse.

{"text": " avoid fracturing or fatigue in the piston pin.\nIn addition, some previously known piston pins have been formed from a tubular body so that the pins are hollow to reduce the mass of the piston assembly. However, tubular piston pins can be deformed during reciprocal movement of the piston, especially when subjected to the high pressures and temperatures existing within the cylinder and the mechanical stresses associated with reciprocating displacement due to combustion. As a result, it has previously been known to completely fill the entire tubular chamber of the piston pin to close the ends of the piston pin. However, such a construction can still result in an unduly massive piston assembly, and the operation of filling the chamber of tubular piston pin can be extremely expensive. For example, formation of a one-piece filler within a tubular pin requires highly controlled introduction of the filler so as to avoid cavities and incomplete filling of the tubular pin.\nIn order to avoid these complications, some previously known tubular piston pins have been enclosed by end caps which frictionally engage the inner periphery of the pin. Such end caps are substantially easier to manufacture and install than previously known means for"}

Dynamic imaging data was reformatted into image files of different time-frames. Patterns of uptake were analysed using the sequences of dynamic frames and time-activity curve (TAC). SLN localisation was successful in 70/73 studies (96%) in 72 patients. Imaging information was present within the first 15 min of dynamic imaging in 67/70 studies (96%). Critical analysis of dynamic data helped to differentiate true SLN from secondary echelon nodes in eight studies and transient foci of radioactivity in six studies. In 17 studies, SLN contained metastatic disease. The detection of SLN metastasis was independent from the use of dynamic imaging.

{"text": " metrology dimensions with high sensitivity and low correlation.\nIn another example, opaque, high-k materials are increasingly employed in modern semiconductor structures. Optical radiation is often unable to penetrate layers constructed of these materials. As a result, measurements with thin-film scatterometry tools such as ellipsometers or reflectometers are becoming increasingly challenging.\nIn response to these challenges, more complex optical metrology tools have been developed. For example, tools with multiple angles of illumination, shorter illumination wavelengths, broader ranges of illumination wavelengths, and more complete information acquisition from reflected signals (e.g., measuring multiple Mueller matrix elements in addition to the more conventional reflectivity or ellipsometric signals) have been developed. However, these approaches have not reliably overcome fundamental challenges associated with measurement of many advanced targets (e.g., complex 3D structures, structures smaller than 10 nm, structures employing opaque materials) and measurement applications (e.g., line edge roughness and line width roughness measurements).\nAtomic force microscopes (AFM) and scanning-tunneling microscopes (STM) are able to achieve atomic resolution, but they can only probe the surface of the specimen. In addition, AFM and STM microscopes require long scanning times. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) achieve intermediate resolution levels,"}
{"text": " pattern form is not accurately transferred to a resist film due to influence of light interference occurring when the optical photolithography is performed, etc. For the purpose of reducing the influence, the photomask pattern sometimes needs to be formed into a more complex form (a form to which optical proximity correction (the so-called OPC) is applied) than an actual circuit pattern. There is accordingly a need for a higher-precision processing method in the photolithography technique to obtain photomask patterns. The performance of lithography may be represented by a resolution limit. The lithography technique in photomask forming processes requires a resolution limit substantially identical to or more than the resolution limit needed in optical photolithography employed in semiconductor processes using photomasks.\nThe procedure for forming a photomask pattern typically involves forming a photoresist film on a photomask blank having a light-shielding film on a transparent substrate, drawing a pattern by an electron beam, obtaining a resist pattern through development, and then etching the light-shielding film to form a light-shielding pattern while using the obtained resist pattern as an etching mask.

Nevertheless, spars are subject to sufficient motion at the ocean surface that this can be a significant design parameter for connected components such as risers which may be subject to significant relative motion with facilities on the spar platform. The risers are subject to buckling failure should a sufficient net compressive load develop in the riser. This would collapse the pathway within the riser necessary for drilling or production operations. Similarly, excess tension from uncompensated support can also damage the riser.\nThus, direct support from the spar platform to the riser requires a riser tensioning system with motion compensation capability to accommodate this relative motion. Whether active or passive, this requires major structural components with long life and moving parts in the harsh offshore environment.\nAlternatively, the riser may be independently supported, e.g., by sufficient, submerged buoyancy modules to ensure a net tension (or at least to avoid an excess compressive load) to protect riser integrity throughout the range of riser motion. However, a riser to platform interface is still required that can accommodate relative motion between the riser and the spar"}

{"text": "z imaging of human skin: Accounting for occlusion effects.\nIn vivo terahertz (THz) imaging of human skin needs to be done in reflection geometry due to the high attenuation of THz light by water in the skin. To aid the measurement procedure, there is typically an imaging window onto which the patient places the area of interest. The window enables better pulse alignment and helps keep the patient correctly positioned during the measurement. In this paper, we demonstrate how the occlusion caused by the skin contact with the imaging window during the measurement affects the THz response. By studying both rapid point measurements and imaging over an area of a human volar forearm, we find that even 5 seconds of occlusion affects the THz response. As the occlusion time increases, the skin surface water content increases, resulting in the reduction of the amplitude of the reflected THz pulse, especially in the first 3 minutes. Furthermore, it was found that the refractive index of the volar forearm increased by 10% to 15% after 20 minutes of occlusion. In this work, we examine and propose a model for the occlusion effects due to the quartz window with a view to compensating for"}

The control device for a vehicle calculates a sideslip speed of the vehicle on the basis of a result of the detection made by the acceleration sensor, and changes a threshold value for determining a possibility of a roll-over in accordance with the calculated sideslip speed (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-71844).\nThe above-mentioned control device for a vehicle calculates a sideslip speed of the vehicle by integrating the acceleration in the width direction, which is detected by the acceleration sensor. The sideslip speed calculated from the acceleration detected by the acceleration sensor is significantly deviated"}

{"text": " strategies that specifically target pathological angiogenesis without affecting physiological angiogenesis. Here we investigated the contribution and therapeutic impact of the endogenous angioinhibitor vasohibin-1 in portal hypertension and cirrhosis. The spatiotemporal expression profiling of vasohibin-1 and its relationship with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiogenesis, and fibrogenesis was determined through the analysis of human cirrhotic liver specimens, widely accepted in vivo animal models of portal hypertension and cirrhosis, and in vitro angiogenesis assays. Effects of vasohibin-1 overexpression by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer on angiogenesis, fibrogenesis, and portal hypertension-associated hemodynamic alterations were also studied in rats. We found that vasohibin-1 and VEGF are up-regulated, in mesentery and liver, in cirrhotic and precirrhotic portal hypertensive rats and cirrhosis patients. Our results are consistent with vasohibin-1/VEGF cascades being spatially and temporally coordinated through a negative-feedback loop driving pathological angiogenesis. Paradoxically, further overexpression of vasohib"}

In T2-weighted examinations at 1.0 T (with present instrumentation), application of the half-Fourier technique leads to a decrease in lesion detectability in patients with multiple sclerosis: this is because there is a reduction in the signal difference-to-noise ratio of 32 +/- 11%.

{"text": " combustion engine generates power by burning fuel in a combustion chamber in an air media drawn into the chamber. Intake valves are operated by a camshaft in order to intake the air, and the air is drawn into the combustion chamber while the intake valves are open. In addition, exhaust valves are operated by the camshaft, and a combustion gas is exhausted from the combustion chamber while the exhaust valves are open.\nOptimal operation of the intake valves and the exhaust valves depends on a rotation speed of the engine. That is, an optimal lift or optimal opening/closing timing of the valves depends on the rotation speed of the engine. In order to achieve such optimal valve operation depending on the rotation speed of the engine, various researches, such as designing of a plurality of cams and a continuous variable valve lift (CVVL) that can change valve lift according to engine speed, have been undertaken.\nAlso,"}

{"text": " has emerged as an important new technology for the study of gene expression. Quantitative in situ hybridization studies have generally relied upon counting of autoradiographic grains in the emulsion overlying cells containing hybridized, radioactively labeled probe. However, such high resolution studies require tedious grain counting over individual cells, frequently in addition to weeks of exposure to nuclear emulsion. The present report describes a quantitative, non-radioactive approach to the detection of a specific mRNA in the brain with the advantages of comparatively rapid tissue processing and computerized image analysis. The validity of this approach was tested by measuring the haloperidol-induced increase in the level of preproenkephalin mRNA in striatal sections of the rat brain using an RNA probe labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP. Detection of probe hybridized to tissue sections was carried out enzymatically following complex formation with an antidigoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Using computerized image analysis, it was found that chronic treatment of rats with haloperidol resulted in a 50 +/- 6% increase in striatal neuronal optical density, a value in good agreement with previous studies using low"}

{"text": "illary ligands are anionic or neutral species. Cationic ones are exceptions and, when used, the positively charged groups are normally attached to the periphery and not close to the donating atom. However, this concept article highlights a series of recent experimental, as well as theoretical results, suggesting that the utility in catalysis of cationic phosphines with no spacer between the phosphorus atom and the positively charged group(s) has been largely overlooked. In fact, a growing number of studies indicate that, because of their specific architecture, these cationic ligands depict excellent π-acceptor character that can exceed that of phosphites or polyfluorinated phosphines. This property has been used to increase the Lewis acidity of the metals they coordinate. Specifically, new extreme π-acid catalysts, mainly based on Pt(II) and Au(I), have been recently prepared and their superior performance demonstrated along several mechanistically distinct transformations. In this concept article the current state of the art is critically assessed and possible future directions of the topic discussed."}

Our data for 293 K illustrate that the addition of citric acid decreases the ERH of ammonium sulfate, which is consistent with the trends observed with other systems containing highly oxygenated organic compounds. At low temperatures the trend is qualitatively the same, but efflorescence can be inhibited by smaller concentrations of citric acid. For example at temperatures <250 K an organic mass/(organic mass + sulfate mass) of only 0.33 is needed to inhibit efflorescence of ammonium sulfate. In the upper troposphere the organic mass/(organic mass + sulfate mass) can often be larger than this value. As a result, particles in the upper troposphere may be more likely to remain in the liquid state than previously thought and"}

William Albright in the 1950s and 1960s published interpretations of Proto-Sinaitic as the key to show the derivation of the Canaanite alphabet from hieratic, leading to the commonly accepted belief that the language of the inscriptions was Semitic and that the script had a hieratic prototype.\n\nThe Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, along with the contemporary parallels found in Canaan and Wadi el-Hol, are thus hypothesized to show an intermediate step between Egyptian Hieratic and the Phoenician alphabet. Brian Colless (2014) notes that 18 of the 22 letters of the Phoenician alphabet have counterparts in the Byblos syllabary, and it seems that the proto-alphabet evolved as a simplification of the syllabary, moving from syllabic to consonantal writing, in the style of the Egyptian script (which did not normally indicate vowels); this goes against the Goldwasser hypothesis (2010) that the original alphabet was invented by miners in Sinai.\n\nAccording to the \"alphabet theory\", the early Semitic proto-alphabet reflected in the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions would"}

In the Drosophila wing, a stripe of Notch activation maintains the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary, through a process that depends on the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we show that the dorsal-ventral boundary exhibits a distinct accumulation of Myosin II, and that this accumulation is regulated downstream of Notch signaling. Conversely, the dorsal-ventral boundary is depleted for the Par-3 homologue Bazooka. We further show that mutations in the Myosin heavy chain subunit encoded by zipper can impair dorsal-ventral compartmentalization without affecting anterior-posterior compartmentalization. These observations identify a distinct accumulation and requirement for Myosin activity in dorsal-ventral compartmentalization, and suggest a novel mechanism in which contractile tension along an F-actin cable at the compartment boundary contributes to"}

Similarly, an exploratory analysis of the combined PRIMO-CABG I and II data set using an established predictive risk model demonstrated a mortality benefit for high-risk surgical patients. Accordingly, the result of these trials supported a moderational model to explain the usefulness of pexelizumab affected by the baseline risk profiles of patients. In this regard, we have commented that pexelizumab may be hazardous to patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention without using adequate anti-thrombotic agents (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antiplatelet inhibitors, clopidogrel and haparin non-responders) according to the results of the experiment by professor Røger and coworkers and the mathematic estimations of the relative risks.

{"text": " cilostamide (PMC medium), followed by 22 hours culture in maturation medium, was designed. The effect of cilostamide on gap junction communications and nuclear status was studied. The variables assessed were chromosome organization, spindle pattern, polar body extrusion, and embryonic development. According to the results, inhibition of PDE3 could not permanently block nuclear maturation in ovine oocytes but it delayed the process of nuclear maturation. Elevation of intra-oocyte cAMP concentration could inhibit cumulus cells expansion and maintain gap junction communications between oocyte and cumulus cells. Deletion of cilostamide and refreshing maturation medium after 22 hours culture revealed that cumulus cells were completely expanded. The inhibitory effect induced by 1 μM cilostamide was reversible, and it increased the number of mature oocytes with aligned chromosomes and normal spindle. However, the inhibitory effects of 10 and 20 μM cilostamide was not fully reversible and was associated with"}
