Clinical studies found that the circulating levels of adiponectin, a peptide secreted from adipocytes, are inversely related to visceral fat mass and bone mineral density, and it has been suggested that adiponectin contributes to the coupling between fat and bone. Our study tested the hypothesis that adiponectin affects bone tissue by comparing the bone phenotype of wild-type and adiponectin-knockout (APN-KO) female mice between the ages of 8-37 weeks. Using a longitudinal study design, we determined body composition and bone density using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. In parallel, groups of animals were killed at different ages and bone properties were analyzed by microcomputed tomography, dynamic histomorphometry, 3-point bending test, nanoindentation, and computational modelling.

{"text": ". Consequently, it is important to consider the efficacy and safety of antiretroviral agents in pregnancy. Protease inhibitors are a common class of medication used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection and are increasingly being used in pregnancy. However, several studies have raised concerns regarding pharmacokinetic alterations in pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, which results in suboptimal drug concentrations and a theoretically higher risk of virologic failure and perinatal transmission. Drug level reductions have been observed with each individual protease inhibitor and dose adjustments in pregnancy are suggested for certain agents. Furthermore, studies have also raised concerns regarding the safety of protease inhibitors in pregnancy, particularly as they may increase the risk of pre-term birth and metabolic disturbances. Overall, protease inhibitors are safe and effective for the treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women. Specifically, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir- and atazanavir-based regimens are preferred in pregnancy, while ritonavir-boosted darunavir- and saquinavir-based therapies are reasonable alternatives. This paper reviews the use of protease inhibitors in pregnancy, focusing on pharmacokinetic and safety considerations, and outlines the recommendations for use of this class of medication in the"}

As the solid domains grow, the remaining fluid domain is deformed, resulting in a curvature stress. Depending on the vesicle size and the bilayer bending rigidity, the solid domain growth may terminate as the gain in cohesive free energy is balanced by the curvature stress of the remaining fluid domain. It is argued that high bending rigidities are required for having a significant super"}

{"text": " station and then re-transmits the signals to end user stations throughout a target area. Ideally, the satellite transmissions are intended to deliver an equitable level of signal power, known as the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), to every end user station within the satellite coverage area. One obstacle in achieving ideal EIRP coverage, however, is the adverse effect of localized signal path losses that are typically caused by weather-related conditions such as rain. That is, rain can attenuate transmitted signal strength to a degree that may result in poor quality reception or even a total loss of signal to an end user.\nTo overcome this problem, some satellite transmission systems have been equipped with power-distribution techniques that can enable the individual adjustment of power to the satellite output feed horns in order to boost the amount of power being transmitted to rain-affected areas. One power-distribution technique utilizes signal amplifiers connected to hybrid matrices in order to share amplifier resources for a number of feed horns. In this type of power pooling arrangement, the amplifiers are generally configured to have identical gain and phase parameters in order to achieve optimal performance of the system. However,"}

More strikingly, even in Cx43 functional deficient B16 and RAW264.7 cells, dioscin still dramatically reversed the aggravated tumor malignancy and reduced macrophage phagocytic activity. Two classical metastasis animal models were utilized in vivo and results showed that dioscin showed significant anti-metastatic effects, which is closely related to the expression of Cx43 either in in situ tumor or metastatic lung nodes. In conclusion, dioscin targets Cx43 to suppress the tumor cell malignancy and activate macrophage sensitivity, thereby targeting melan"}

However, this seems less likely for experienced assessors (as their assessment should not be as strongly influenced by the training which was only a reminder for them). Decreased concentration after scoring many hens may also have contributed to the lower accuracy of both types of assessor in the second session. Taken together, these findings suggest that although deviation assessment by palpation is a technique that can be applied reliably after a short training, it can be improved by increased experience.

Here we comprehensively characterise the extent to which these appear together across some 950 bacterial species and test for statistically significant patterns of correlated gain and loss. Our analysis provides evidence for correlated evolution but also a high level of evolutionary flexibility: at the sequence level, histidine kinases but especially response regulators belonging to different TCSs in a species"}

However, to minimize the cost of testing and to maximize testing throughput, it is important to test DRAMs as quickly as possible. In the past, the rate at which DRAMs can be tested has been increased by compressing the data written to and read from DRAMs. Using data compression, data applied to the DRAM is written to several memory cells, either simultaneously or sequentially in a single memory access cycle. Compressed data is then read from the DRAM by simultaneously coupling data bits from several memory cells to a logic circuit that provides an indication of whether the data read from the memory cells corresponds to the data written to the memory cells. Data compression can markedly reduce the time required to test a DRAM, with the reduction being roughly proportional to the degree of compression. Data compression techniques have been used with a variety of DRAMs, including asynchronous DR"}

The play imagines that Primo conjures the prophet Elijah as part of a story he is trying to write and the prophet simply does not leave. Primo creates Elijah as the embodiment of hope, however he finds the prophet to be more cantankerous and oppositional than expected. Nonetheless, Elijah is a cathartic conversant, who attempts to guide Primo through his memories and help him to put down the burden of bearing witness. At first Primo is resistant to this Virgil / Dante relationship, but he is quickly swept away in the tide of a new perspective on his life’s work. While the question of Levi’s suicide has to be part of telling his story, the play is not an autopsy. Drowned or Saved? celebrates Primo’s famous qualities of vitality and resilience. Peppered with cheeky Yiddish humour, the play is a miniature portrait of one of the Twentieth Century’s greatest thinkers.\n\nDrowned or Saved? is"}

From 1967 through 1981, 207 rotational humeral osteotomies were performed. Follow-up was possible on 180 of these shoulders. The over-all redislocation rate was 5.7 per cent and the rate of non-traumatic redislocation, 1.1 per cent. Limitation of motion of more than 10 degrees was present in only 3.9 per cent, the maximum limitation of external rotation being 15 degrees in one patient. The average loss of external rotation was less than 5 degrees, without noticeable diminution of power or function in most patients. The results as graded by a standard rating scale were good to excellent in 90 per cent, fair in 3 per cent, and poor in 7 per cent of the patients. The fair and poor results were due to redislocation, delayed union or non-union, post-traumatic arthritis, and over-rotation at the osteotomy site. Reoperation was necessary in two patients with a non-traumatic recurrence, in six patients with delayed union or non-union, and in one patient"}

Here, we review cellular responses to biophysical cues and discuss their clinical relevancy and application.

The phosphorylation of 112 kDa protein is greatly reduced or absent in unstimulated T cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that 112 kDa protein is labeled on a serine. Add-back experiments using purified protein kinases indicate that 112 kDa protein serves as a substrate for casein kinase II. Phosphorylation of 112 kDa protein by the endogenous kinase is inhibited by heparin, a known casein kinase II inhibitor. The site or sites modified by the endogenous kinase and exogenous casein kinase II appear identical by peptide-mapping experiments. A time-course of the appearance of phosphorylated 112 kDa protein following stimulation with concanavalin A, measured in the presence or absence of added casein kinase II, suggests that 112 kDa protein is induced in activated T cells.

{"text": ", we here examined the impact of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on the activity of the putamen and premotor areas while performing the serial prediction task. To this end, we measured eight male PD patients ON and OFF deep brain stimulation and eight healthy age-matched male controls using [15O] water positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral blood flow. As expected, PD patients showed poorer performance than healthy controls while performance did not differ between OFF and ON stimulation. Hypoactivity of the putamen and hyperactivity of the left lateral premotor cortex was found in patients compared to controls. Lateral premotor hyperactivity further increased OFF compared to ON stimulation and was positively related to task performance. These results confirm that the motor loop's dysfunction has impact on cognitive processes (here: prediction of serial stimuli) in PD. Extending prior data regarding the role of the lateral premotor cortex in cognitive compensation, our results indicate that lateral premotor"}

{"text": " involved in allergic contact dermatitis.\nAllergic contact dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin disease caused by agents such as plants, chemical compounds, and topical medications. Histologic features typically include edema within the epidermis and dermis and a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with an admixture of basophils. Langerhans cells and keratinocytes play pivotal roles in allergic contact dermatitis reactions. Langerhans cells synthesize and express class II molecules that allow the presentation of exogenous antigens to T lymphocytes. Additionally, keratinocytes and Langerhans cells produce interleukin-1, which is thought to be a second signal that activates T cells. Mast cells and basophils also may play a proinflammatory role. Treatment primarily consists of removal of the offending agent. At times, systemic corticosteroids may be required, especially in the acute phase.

We quantify these effects with the global hybrid general equilibrium model Imaclim-R and show that they are quantitatively important. Indeed, for a given unilateral abatement in OECD countries, leakage is more than halved in a scenario with CCS included among the abatement options, compared to a scenario prohibiting CCS.

{"text": " delivery, a phenomenon referred to as low-frequency sonophoresis. This study provides an investigation of the dependence of low-frequency sonophoresis on various ultrasound parameters, including the distance of the horn from the skin, intensity, and frequency. We performed in vitro experiments with full thickness pig skin to measure enhancements of skin conductivity and drug permeability. Ultrasound was applied to pretreat the skin using a sonicator operating at a frequency of either 20 or 40 kHz. We also measured pitting of aluminum foil to measure cavitation, which is the principal mechanism of low-frequency sonophoresis. The skin conductivity enhancement was found to be inversely proportional to the distance of the horn from the skin. As the intensity increased, skin conductivity enhancement also increased up to a certain threshold, and then dropped off. The intensities (I(max)) at which maximum enhancement occur are about 14 W/cm2 for 20 kHz and 17 W/cm2 for 40 kHz. These findings may be useful in optimizing low-frequency sonophoresis. Overall, the dependence of transport on ultrasound parameters is similar to that of aluminum foil pitting. These results support the role of cavitation in low-frequency sonophoresis"}

Therefore, the application of objective data in the evaluation of speech rehabilitation after cochlear implantation was investigated. eCaps of all electrodes were measured intraoperatively. The 'threshold' and 'comfort' levels, speech recognition and pure tone thresholds were determined at follow-up. The correlation coefficient was calculated between eCap thresholds and psychoacoustic levels. This correlation coefficient was ranked with other individual items in relation to their influence on the development of speech recognition. Only the duration of preimplant deafness, the pure tone hearing threshold and the correlation between eCAP and psychoacoustic levels have a significant influence on the rehabilitation within this selection of variables. Based on these results, an individualized mathematical modeling approach was introduced to"}

{"text": ".\n\nCreate partnerships. Partnerships between ship operators and ship owners, ports, or bunker suppliers can play a key role in lowering costs. When implemented correctly, partnerships between operators and owners can produce wins for both parties. These partnerships are especially valuable for container carriers that operate time charter vessels. BCG’s CBI has found that such vessels have slightly higher bunker costs than vessels owned by carriers. Because the carriers pay for bunker in a time charter arrangement, ship owners and their crews typically lack incentives to curtail bunker consumption. To address this, carriers should work with the owners of time charter vessels to apply best practices in fuel efficiency and to permit the installation of consumption-monitoring equipment and energy-saving devices. The parties can agree to share the savings, with the owner receiving higher charter rates if the carrier can reduce its bunker costs as a result of these efforts. Shipping companies can also partner with ports and bunker suppliers to identify ways to create value, such as by agreeing to fuel-type availability, pumping rates, minimum hours of delay"}

There were three basic needs that must guide any party in protecting the nation’s vital interests: (1) Britain must guard its home base, the British Isles, against any attack, especially from across the Straits of Dover or the southern part of the North Sea. If a strong power held the other side of the Straits, Belgium, or the mouth of the Scheldt, it could hold a pistol at the head of England; and if any such power dominated the Continent, especially the western half, it might menace the British Isles.

The chain in 1 is built from alternating bis(azide) and (azide)bis(carboxylate) bridges, while that in 2 contains uniform (azide) (carboxylate) bridges. The MOFs shows the characteristic redox properties of the viologen moieties. The redox activity affords the MOFs with different chromic properties, owing to subtle differences in chemical environments. 1 shows reversible photochromism, which is related to the radical formation through photoinduced electron transfer from azide-carboxylate to viologen according to UV-vis, X-ray photoelectron, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy and DFT calculations. 2 is nonphotochromic for lack of appropriate pathways for electron transfer. Unexpectedly, 2 shows a novel type of solid-state hydrochromism. Upon the removal and reabsorption of water, the compound shows remarkable color change because of reversible electron transfer accompanying a reversible structural transformation.

{"text": " the internet. A recent report from the RAND Corporation revealed 99 percent of teachers in this country use \"materials I developed and/or selected myself\" as part of their literacy instruction.\n\nAnd this is no small task. Almost half of teachers reported spending four or more hours a week searching for materials, with Google and Pinterest the most frequently consulted websites. Frustratingly, most of those hours are probably wasted trying to distinguish a few educationally sound resources amongst the clutter. And we know that in addition to teacher effectiveness, the quality of the instructional materials they employ is one of the most critical factors in student achievement.\n\n“We’re seeing a need for concrete, ready-to-use materials that teachers can take and run with, but that also have a long-lasting impact on student learning,” explain Joey Hawkins and Diana Leddy of the Vermont Writing Collaborative. “Open source materials run the range and it can be a real challenge for teachers to navigate everything that’s out there.” They’re right. There are a lot of education resources out there, free for the taking—the challenge is figuring out what’s worthy of precious instructional time.\n\nClearly, there’s an urgent need to empower teachers and leaders to make good decisions about the instructional materials they choose.

{"text": " interest groups. English liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill supported corporatist-like economic associations as needing to predominate in society to create equality for labourers and give them a voice in management through democratic economic rights. Unlike a number of other forms of corporatism, liberal corporatism does not reject capitalism or individualism, but believes that a business is a social institution that requires its managers to go beyond achieving the bottom line, by recognizing the needs of their members. This liberal corporatist ethic was similar to Taylorism but called for democratization of the capitalism firm. Liberal corporatists believed that inclusion of all members in the election of management would bring them into the process of management and in effect \"reconcile ethics and efficiency, freedom and order, liberty and rationality\".\n\nLiberal corporatism was an influential component of the progressivism in the United States that has been referred to as \"interest group liberalism\". The support by labour leaders' advocacy of liberal corporatism of the U.S. progressives is believed to have been influenced by an attraction to the syndicalism and particularly the anarcho-syndicalism at the time in Europe. In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the New Deal economic program of the United"}

The winding speed is especially important for sheet materials including film and adhesive combinations where the majority of the adhesive lies in the recesses of the film. Although various mechanisms and apparatuses have been proposed for winding and unwinding operations, problems have been presented in maintaining a uniform wound product.\nIn various manufacturing operations for producing textiles, felts, papers, films, etc., it is necessary to wind a sheet of material into a roll. Where the sheet of material is a uniform and repeatable rolled consumer product, the roll may be referred to as a log. Consumer product logs are often much smaller than the commercial rolls used in other applications. Further, sheets of material such as paper products or film-adhesive combinations may have little or no tension applied at certain points in the rolling process. The winding quality and material properties such as thickness and appearance are strongly influenced by the tension that is present in the sheet of material during the winding operation. This is particularly true for the winding of adhesively coated sheets of material such as film-adhesive combinations. During winding, the"}

{"text": " induced by immune stimulation in honeybees (Apis mellifera): a potential mediator of social immunity?\nSocial removal is often an adaptive response for preventing the entry and spread of parasitic infection between kin members of a group. Social isolation via removal or the switching of social tasks has also been observed in insect societies; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We tested in honeybees the role of the immune system in physiological and behavioral modulation. Forager bees are often located in the outer area of the colony, and thus have reduced contacts with individuals of high importance, who are located in the inner area of the colony (e.g. queen and brood). We thus expected that an immune challenge would induce a forager profile. This was confirmed by measuring brain (foraging and malvolio gene expression), physiological (hypopharyngeal glands size) and behavioral (queen attendance) parameters of nurse/forager profiles after a treatment with an immune-activator (lipopolysaccharides). Our results support the idea that the interplay between the brain and immune system may"}

Responses were elicited from the programme participants through the use of pre- and post-test questionnaires, with a view to identifying effective health education strategies for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS among young Nigerian women. Outcomes revealed low knowledge levels, poor attitudes and misconceptions about HIV/AIDS as well as widespread stigma. This indicates a continual need for the design and implementation of a comprehensive and culturally appropriate HIV/AIDS and sexual health program for young women in Nigeria which meets their needs."}

The scope for increasing the data rate of electronic signals is often limited by signal integrity considerations. Also, increasing the bandwidth of data paths increases cost and may be impractical. The energy efficiency of elements of the data center has become an important consideration, because as data rates increase a greater proportion of the power consumed by network switches can be attributed to electronic interconnects. Moreover, electronic switched fabrics typically used to handle switching in a data center, use point-to-point flow control on each individual link. As a result, flow control is buffered on every link in order to avoid data loss. Switch manufacturers and users continue to seek inter"}

However, many of such presumably closed wounds may still remain \"functionally\" open and deficient in skin barrier function, putting them at higher risk of recidivism.

Electroless coating has been used to uniformly disperse Nickel in alumina matrix as a source material. The electroless Ni coated alumina particles are subjected to both laser processing and Air Plasma Spraying with optimized parameters. Consolidation by laser processing could not be achieved as the laser beam was reflective to Nickel.

The energy tolerance for the electronic structure determinations was set at 10^--7^ eV to ensure accuracy. We use a *k*-space grids of size: 4 × 4 × 1 for bilayers, 4 × 4 × 2 for two-layer solids, and 4 × 4 × 1 for six-layer solids. Test calculations involving expansion of these grids to double those sizes were shown to affect calculated energy differences by less than 1 meV. VASP performs periodic imaging in all three dimensions and so to model bilayers we introduced a vacuum region of *ca.* 15 Å between the periodic images in the direction normal to the bilayer. To minimize interactions between these periodic images we applied dipolar correction as implemented in VASP (by setting the \"IDIPOL\" to \"TRUE\") in early calculations. However, the effect was found to be negligible (\\<1 meV) and so this sometimes troublesome procedure was no longer applied.

The fact that medulloblastomas rarely metastasize outside the CNS but rather spread almost exclusively to the spinal and intracranial leptomeninges has fostered the long-held belief that medulloblastoma cells spread directly through the CSF, not the bloodstream. In this paper the authors discuss selected molecules for which experimental evidence explains how the effects of each molecule on cell physiology contribute mechanistically to LMD. A model of medulloblastoma LMD is described, analogous to the invasion-metastasis cascade of hematogenous metastasis of carcinomas. The LMD cascade is based on the molecular themes that 1) transcription factors launch cell programs that mediate cell motility and invasiveness and maintain tumor cells in a stem-like state; "}

In patients with ER-negative breast cancer, time-dependent analyses revealed that the hazard of late relapses could mainly be attributed to the overweight and obese patients. Within the subgroup of premenopausal patients with ER-positive tumours, obesity was associated with an early high narrow peak of distant recurrences followed by another main peak after 5 years of follow-up. The risk for overweight patients was intermediate between obese and normal-weight patients. In the postmenopausal subgroup of patients with ER-positive tumours, the distant recurrence rate was significantly more elevated in the overweight patients compared to the other BMI categories, and a second late peak of recurrences was also observed for the obese patients. These results demonstrate that the patient's BMI at diagnosis is associated with cancer recurrence dynamics. Patient adiposity should therefore be central to the exploration of"}

{"text": " motor system in a simple motor task of lifting a series of virtual objects for five persons with spastic dCP and five age-matched controls. When a person lifts an object, s/he uses an expectation of the weight of the object to generate a motor command. We asked the study subjects to lift a series of increasing weights and determined whether they extrapolated from past experience to predict the next weight in the series, even though that weight had never been experienced. Planning of precision grasp was assessed by measurement of the grip force at the beginning of the lifting task and by estimating the motor command. Execution of precision grasp was assessed by measurement of the time interval between the onset of grip and the onset of movement. We found that persons with dCP demonstrated a lack of predictive feed-forward control in their lifting movements: they exhibited a significantly longer time between onset of grip and onset of movement than the control subjects and they did not predict the weight of the next object in the lifting task. In addition, for subjects with dCP, the time between the onset of grip and the onset of movement of the dominant hand correlated strongly with the outcome of a hand function test.

HOXA13 overexpression significantly increased CDH17 mRNA and protein expression and also significantly increased the transcription activity of the luciferase reporter with integrate HOXA13 binding sites. HOXA13 shRNA and CDH17 shRNA had similar effect on reducing the expression of beta-catenin, while shCDH17 abrogated HOXA13 induced upregulation of beta-catenin.

{"text": "ampled by arrays of similar sampling circuitry clocked by multiple-phase (xe2x80x9cmulti-phasexe2x80x9d) clocks in order to simulate a single much faster device. Oversampling of such high-speed signals makes it possible to use comparatively slow CMOS devices for high-speed applications such as communications and computing by using multiple-phase clocks to process high-speed signals in parallel. Correspondingly, as the underlying signal frequency increases, the number of clock phases needed to accommodate the signal frequency increases.\nIn many devices today, ring oscillators are used to generate multiple-phase clocks. However, this technique suffers from a number of disadvantages in the environment just described. More specifically, the quality of a multi-phase clock degrades as the number of clock phases increases. Furthermore, generation of a larger number of multiple-phase clocks makes layout and routing more difficult in an integrated circuit chip.\nAnother technique used to generate multi-phase clocks employs cascaded voltage-controlled oscillator (xe2x80x9cVCOxe2x80x9d) cell stages.

The trial court ruled that, as a matter of law, defendant was acting within the course and scope of her employment as a supervisor when the allegedly slanderous statements were made; hence that plaintiffs' failure to file a claim against her employer, the City and County of San Francisco, was fatal to plaintiffs' slander action against defendant. We agree and find this issue dispositive of the appeal.\nIn their opening brief on appeal, plaintiffs concede that a duly elected supervisor is an employee for the purposes of section 950.2 of the Government Code, and they also concede that the wrongfulness of an employee's conduct (in this instance the making of slanderous statements) cannot be taken into consideration when determining whether an employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment. However, plaintiffs contend that, in this instance, the trial court erred in concluding that defendant was acting within the scope of her employment as a matter of law.

The type of CCA are associated with Helicobacter spp. include extrahepatic CCA, and common bile duct cancer. Up to the present, however, the results from different regions, materials and methods, sub-sites of cancer, and controls have not been consistent, thus introducing heterogeneity.

{"text": " membership turnover. This study presents a longitudinal analysis of 891 WikiProjects where we model the impact of member turnover and social capital losses on project productivity. By examining social capital losses we attempt to provide a more nuanced analysis of member turnover. In this context social capital is modelled from a social network perspective where the loss of more central members has more impact. We find that only a small proportion of WikiProjects are in a relatively healthy state with low levels of membership turnover and social capital losses. The results show that the relationship between social capital losses and project performance is U-shaped, and that member withdrawal has significant negative effect on project outcomes. The results also support the mediation of turnover rate and network density on the curvilinear relationship.'\nauthor:\n- |\n    Xiangju Qin[$^{\\sharp}$]{}, Michael Salter-Townshend[$"}

However, for rats beginning alcohol consumption as adolescents, the alpha2/3 activity was significantly elevated following chronic alcohol consumption. Both LE and Sprague-Dawley rats showed this same selective increase in cortical alpha2/3 activity when rats began alcohol consumption as juveniles. The shift in cortical alpha2/3 activity was not observed in cerebellum or subcortical forebrain and was reversible when rats were fed ethanol throughout the normal adolescent period and then withdrawn and tested 2 weeks later (during the adult period).

Until 1908, the Jewish population in Beirut grew by migration from the Syrian interior and from other Ottoman cities like Izmir, Salonica, Istanbul, and Baghdad. Commercial growth in the thriving port-city, consular protection, and relative safety and stability in Beirut all accounted for the Jewish migration. Thus, from a few hundred at the beginning of the 19th century, the Jewish community grew to 2,500 by the end of the century, and to 3,500 by the First World War. While the number of Jews grew considerably, the community remained largely unorganized. During this period, the community lacked some of the fundamental institutions such as communal statutes, elected council, welfare and taxation mechanisms. In this period, the most organized and well-known Jewish institution in the city was probably the private Tiferet Israel (The Glory of Israel) boarding-school founded by Zaki Cohen"}

Myeloma cells stimulate osteoclastogenesis by triggering an increase in RANKL and decrease in OPG in bone marrow cells.

Moreover, polyclonal antibodies naturally comprise a mixture of different antibodies, each directed against different antigenic structures of the particular epitope. Consequently it is not possible, by means of polyclonal antibodies, to identify the same antigenic structure reproducibly again and again.\nAnother disadvantage of polyclonal antibodies is that they sometimes display very high cross reactivities with other proteins that are not of interest, which greatly restricts their use in immunoblotting or in immunoprecipitation and makes a diagnostic or therapeutic use of this mixture impossible.\nThere is therefore an increased need for the supply of monoclonal antibodies that are directed against Frizzled receptors, and especially against the human variants. However, it turns out that production of these monoclonal antibodies is particularly difficult, as Frizzled receptors in the animal kingdom are very highly conserved with respect to their amino acid sequence and therefore their three-dimensional structure.

Robot operators have been seriously injured and killed partly due to misperception of these nontraditional characteristics of robotic systems. This research addresses the perceptual hazards associated with robotic systems and offers experimental data to design and maintain safer robotic work stations. Experiment #1 investigates operator perception of robot arm speed and determines the maximum speed that robot operators judge to be \"safe\". As an industrial robot performs a simulated 10-minute pick-and-place palletizing task, the subjects will be instructed to adjust the robot's maximum arm speed (up or down) until a final \"safe\" speed is determined. To protect the subjects, all the experimental sessions are conducted with subjects positioned outside the robot's working envelope using empty robot grippers. Experiment #2 investigates the minimum amount of time for robot arm inactivity (idle time) to be perceived as either programmed stop or system problem such as malfunction.

Let’s see the Jews in all their misery, Augustine said, so we can rejoice in what’s become of them. More liberal times evolved more devious strategies of calumny. Few western intellectuals or churchmen today can afford to trumpet their anti-Semitism, or even admit to themselves that their consciences harbor such emotions.

Ali introduces the work by describing the historical subjugation of Russian working-class, peasants, through a system of Autocratic Tsarist regime, the conservative Russian Orthodox Church, and the upper-class. Marxism and socialism had a decisive appeal for Russian dissidents, the underprivileged and revolutionaries. Prominent Russian socialist thought developed in the form of the Anarchism with Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin, Tolstoyian Christianity, Russian Liberalism, and Marxist philosopher Plekhanov. Tariq broadens this image of Russian to the international appeal of Socialism and Marxism during this period of time, using the example of the historical popularity of socialism in The United States in the form of Eugene V.

All interviews were conducted in Spanish. Several common themes emerged from the data: (a) fear, \"I got scared\"; (b) the acute care experience, \"I was not told what to do, nothing\"; (c) knowledge, \"I did not know anything about asthma\"; and (d) parent alternative strategies or strengths, \"We want to do what is best.... we need to be prepared.\" Strength emerged from fear.

The prognosis of infant-onset atopic dermatitis is generally favorable and more than 90% of children show remission or healing within several years.

The pressure dependence of the dissociation reaction for the parallel-packed material showed that the activation volume decreased linearly with length while the Gibbs energy increased.

If his/her friend performs the desired action (e.g., purchase) then the user can receive some reward from the advertiser (e.g., product discount, loyalty rewards) because the referral was successful.\nOne problem with such an approach to rewards is that it looks only at the number of successful referrals a user has generated. This approach inherently promotes users to send out a large number of referrals, even referrals to persons that may have little interest in the advertised"}

Here we discovered in preliminary studies that in ALI models there is a deficiency of a crucial cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory mitochondrial homeostat, Parkin, through its elimination by a relatively new E3 ligase protein, Fbxo7. By targeting the FP molecular signature present in Fbxo7, we designed and tested a novel small molecule inhibitor, BC1464, which stabilizes mitochondrial function and reduces inflammation in murine and human ALI models. Hence, in this application we will first elucidate how bacterial pathogens deplete Parkin through Fbxo7, thereby accentuating experimental ALI (Aim 1). We will specifically elucidate how Fbxo7 targets Parkin for its degradation using complementary in vitro and in vivo genetic models. Next, we will optimize the pharmacologic design and test a novel"}

The technology used to manufacture image sensors, and in particular, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (“CMOS”) image sensors, has continued to advance at great pace. For example, the demands of higher resolution and lower power consumption have encouraged the further miniaturization and integration of these image sensors.\nCMOS image sensors can use arrays of pixels. A pixel generally includes a photodiode (i.e., a photo-sensitive region responsible for collecting electromagnetic energy and converting the collected electromagnetic energy into electrons), a transfer transistor, a source follower amplifier transistor, and a row select transistor. Photo-generated charge accumulated in the photosensitive region of the photodiode is ultimately converted into a voltage by a charge-to-voltage mechanism (also referred to as a floating diffusion) included in the pixel.\nSome image sensors may include a shared pixel architecture, where photodiodes are grouped together to form pixel units that have a shared charge-to-voltage mechanism, as well as one or more shared transistors, among several photodiodes.\nThe efficiency with which the photosensitive regions of a pixel unit converts incident electromagnetic energy into accumulated electrons depends"}

Recent analyses of clinically successful cemented femoral components obtained in toto with the surrounding cement and femurs after many years of in-vivo service have suggested that the mechanism of the initiation of failure of fixation of cemented femoral components is debonding at the cement-metal interface. Since this critical interface is subjected primarily to cyclic loading, the evaluation of different surface preparations should be studied in fatigue, not static testing. In the current study, several contemporary methods for increasing the strength of the cement-metal interface were evaluated by testing the interfacial fatigue pushout strength under varying conditions of cyclic loading. The effect of a smooth 'implant finish' surface, a surface coated with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA precoated surface), a combination of a textured surface with PMMA precoat, and a porous titanium mesh coated surface were examined. Precoating the metal with a thin film of PMMA significantly increased the number of compressive fatigue loading cycles required for failure of the cement-metal interface under cyclic"}

{"text": " system is software code that provides basic functions allowing a user or users to interact with a computer. For example, an operating system provides the user with commands for opening files, closing files, printing files, displaying data objects on a display screen, as well as many other functions.\nIn a computer system that is designed to service a single user only, a single copy of software code is required to provide these functions. As the user performs actions requiring operating system intervention, the appropriate section of the operating system code services the user request. In a system that services multiple users, however, it becomes unwieldy to provide a separate copy of the operating system code for each user.\nThis problem has been addressed in some multi-user operating systems by providing only a single copy of certain segments of the operating system code which are shared among many or all of the users. For example, WINDOWS NT.TM., an operating system produced and sold by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., provides only a single copy of the code necessary to implement graphics functions, i.e. display data objects on a display screen.

Additional research tools are needed to expand the repertoire of available CAR-T therapies. Characterizing the performance of novel antigen/CAR-T combinations responsible for tumor clearance has proven to be a difficult challenge. We are developing a technology, PANACEA, that allows us to probe the behavior of a chimeric antigen receptor and its activation in a cellular context. Innovation: The core of the platform is an engineered cell line that contains an activatable synthetic reporter pathway. Upon CAR-T binding and cell activation, a reporter gene (e.g. a fluorescent protein) is expressed. This allows the researcher to detect activation events and use platforms such as cell sorting to isolate and study activated cells. By changing input parameters, PANACEA enables the"}

Molded macroporous rod columns are ideally suited for this technique because convection through the large pores of the rod enhances the mass transport of large analyte molecules and accelerates the separation process.

{"text": " on teeth restored using ceramic inlays: An approach based on three-dimensional finite element analysis and ultrahigh-speed camera.\nCeramic fracture and debonding are the primary failures that follow ceramic inlay and can lead to stress and tooth fracture. In this study, we examined two designs-concave and flat-of the gingival cavity bottom for tooth cavities restored using ceramic inlays. We investigated the biomechanical behavior of ceramic inlay-restored teeth (concave and flat) through three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) and experimentally validated the results using an ultrahigh-speed camera. We conducted in vitro real-time recording of the deformation of a restored tooth during loading using an ultrahigh-speed camera. This technique enables further image registration to observe deformation variation and vector fields. The deformation vector fields revealed that the concave design moved the deformation toward the buccal side of the cavity bottom, whereas the flat design moved it toward the palatal side. These findings correlated with the FEA results, which indicated that the concave design constrained stress in the dentin cavity and relieved pal"}

This is a coating that acts as natural concrete to be used on your chimney, or wherever a flexible waterproof membrane is needed.\n\nRebuilding the Chimney Crown\n\nRebuilding the Chimney Crown In cases where the chimney crown is too far deteriorated to simply seal, rebuilding it may be necessary. A little more labor is involved when tearing down the cement crown and building a new one. Sometimes staging or a platform must be installed in order to do the demolition and rebuilding. A new crown can be up to a hundred or more lbs of masonry. This is something SafeSide Chimney specializes in.\n\nPre-Cast Crowns\n\nOn single flue chimneys, installation of a pre-cast crown is an option.

The study population consisted of 25 instrumented Large-White pigs (30 kg to 40 kg).

{"text": " increased metabolic rate, secretion of metabolic hormones, and behavioral responses, is studied in detail. By correlating alterations in these various parameters, an attempt is made to provide a synthesis of the coordinated responses. The neurochemical mechanisms within the hypothalamus at the base of the brain which mediate the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary are studied by microinjection of putative neurotransmitters into discrete regions. Fully conscious baboons loosely restrained in primate chairs are studied in these experiments. Blood samples drawn from chronic catheters in veins and arteries are analyzed for hormonal and substrate (fuel) changes. Thus, the regulation of the hormones concerned with ovulation (LH) and lactation (prolactin) as well as with thermoregulation (TSH, ACTH, growth hormone) may be studied.

VSMC were transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing a full length PKCalpha cDNA insert, and a stable transfectant overexpressing PKCalpha was obtained as evidenced by increased expression of PKCalpha mRNA and protein. In response to 100 ng/ml LPS stimulation, the PKCalpha transfectants showed a 1.8-fold increase in PKC activity at 30 min and a twofold increase in NO production over 24 hr compared with cells transfected with control plasmids. The LPS-stimulated increase in NO synthesis in PKCalpha transfectants was blocked by the specific PKCalpha inhibitor Gö 6976. After 6 hr LPS treatment, PKCalpha-transfected and control cells showed equivalent increases in mRNA and protein for the induc"}
{"text": " sensor circuitry adapted to measure impedance and to obtain one or more measured impedance signals. The sensor circuitry is further adapted to generate one or more arc detection signals upon detecting an arcing condition. This is accomplished by passing the measured impedance tissue signal through a high pass filter and then passing the absolute value of the high pass filter through a low pass filter. The resulting filtered signal is the arc detection signal that is scaled and capped. The system disclosed by Wham further includes a controller adapted to generate one or more target control signals as a function of the measured impedance signals and to adjust the output of the electrosurgical generator based on the arc detection signal. Wham discloses detecting arcing by monitoring for rapidly repeating changes in measured signal such as the impedance signal and generating an arc detection signal. Since the system as disclosed by Wham relies on measuring changes in the impedance signal, it will result in the detection of an arcing condition and controlling of the output even if the arcing is insignificant."}

Individual recommendations were classified based on their strength of recommendation (levels A through C) and quality of evidence (levels I through III). Guidelines not following this format were excluded from further analysis. Evolution of IDSA guidelines was assessed by comparing 5 recently updated guidelines with their earlier versions. In the 41 analyzed guidelines, 4218 individual recommendations were found and tabulated. Fourteen percent of the recommendations were classified as level I, 31% as level II, and 55% as level III evidence. Among class A recommendations (good evidence for support), 23% were level I (≥1 randomized controlled trial) and 37% were based on expert opinion only (level III). Updated guidelines expanded the absolute number of individual recommendations substantially.

{"text": "z circulated a paper entitled “Why High Leverage is Optimal for Banks.” The title of the paper is important here: it strongly suggests that the authors are claiming something about actual banks in the real world. In the introduction to this paper the authors explain what their model is designed to do:\n\nTo establish that high bank leverage is the natural (distortion-free) result of intermediation focused on liquid-claim production, the model rules out agency problems, deposit insurance, taxes, and all other distortionary factors. By positing these idealized conditions, the model obviously ignores some important determinants of bank capital structure in the real world. However, in contrast to the MM framework – and generalizations that include only leverage-related distortions – it allows a meaningful role for banks as producers of liquidity and shows clearly that, if one extends the MM model to take that role into account, it is optimal for banks to have high leverage. [emphasis added]\n\nTheir model, in other words, is designed to show that if we rule out many important things and just focus on one factor alone, we obtain the particular result that banks should be highly leveraged. This argument is for all intents and purpose analogous"}
{"text": "yringe-injectable mesh electronics represent a new paradigm for brain science and neural prosthetics by virtue of the stable seamless integration of the electronics with neural tissues, a consequence of the macroporous mesh electronics structure with all size features similar to or less than individual neurons and tissue-like flexibility. These same properties, however, make input/output (I/O) connection to measurement electronics challenging, and work to-date has required methods that could be difficult to implement by the life sciences community. Here we present a new syringe-injectable mesh electronics design with plug-and-play I/O interfacing that is rapid, scalable, and user-friendly to nonexperts. The basic design tapers the ultraflexible mesh electronics to a narrow stem that routes all of the device/electrode interconnects to I/O pads that are inserted into a standard zero insertion force (ZIF) connector. Studies show that the entire plug-and-play mesh electronics can be delivered through capillary needles with precise targeting using microliter-scale injection volumes similar to the standard mesh electronics design.
